## Build and test

Now it's time to make your project. Start small, and add more to your project if you have time.

**Tip:** Remember to test your project each time you add something. It is much easier to find and fix bugs before you make more changes.

You will need to decide in what order to build your project. You could:

+ Create one variable and allow the user to control it. Add animations, costumes, sound and effects and conversation to make the sprite really come to life 
+ Create multiple variables with simple ways for the user to control them, and then add more effects later.

Adding a sprite and then creating a `variable`{:class="block3variables"} is a great start.

You have built up some really useful skills. Here is a reminder to help you make your project: 

### Using variables

```blocks3
set [my variable v] to (0)
```

[[[scratch3-create-set-variable]]]

[[[scratch3-set-variable-with-button]]]

[[[scratch3-change-variable-in-loop]]]

### Checking conditions

```blocks3
if <(my variable) = (0)> then
```

[[[scratch3-forever-condition]]]

[[[scratch3-operators-conditions]]]

[[[scratch3-if-then-else]]]

[[[scratch3-set-block-input-colour-with-eyedropper]]]

### Broadcasting and receiving messages

```blocks3
broadcast [message1 v]
```

[[[generic-scratch3-broadcast-message]]]

### Working with text:

```blocks3
say (join[Hello ](name)) for (2) seconds
```

[[[scratch3-emoji-text]]]

[[[scratch3-ask-answer-chat]]]

[[[scratch3-join-text]]]

### Backdrops, movement and graphic effects

```blocks3
set [ghost v] effect to (0)
```

[[[scratch3-glide-to-object]]]

[[[scratch3-changing-backdrops-pages-levels]]]

[[[scratch3-change-costumes-to-show-mood]]]

[[[scratch3-animate-movement-costumes]]]

[[[scratch3-graphic-effects]]]

[[[scratch3-show-hide-sprites-backdrops]]]

[[[scratch3-positioning-with-layers]]]

[[[scratch3-jiggle-a-sprite]]]

### Sound:

```blocks3
start sound (Pop v)
```

[[[scratch3-add-sound]]]

[[[scratch3-record-sound]]]

[[[scratch3-text-to-speech]]]

### Paint editor — backdrops and costumes

[[[scratch3-paint-a-new-backdrop-extended]]]

[[[scratch3-backdrops-and-sprites-using-shapes]]]

[[[scratch3-use-text-tool]]]

[[[scratch3-copy-parts-between-sprite-costumes]]]

[[[scratch3-add-costumes-to-a-sprite]]]

### Scratch editor

[[[scratch3-copy-code]]]

[[[scratch3-full-screen]]]

[[[scratch3-duplicate-sprite]]]

**Test:** Show someone else your project and get their feedback. Do you want make any changes to your book?

**Debug:** You might find some bugs in your project that you need to fix. Here are some common bugs.

---
title: Variables aren't updating correctly
---

One common mistake is to confuse the `change`{:class="block3variables"} and `set`{:class="block3variables"} blocks. 

+ `set`{:class="block3variables"} replaces the value of a variable with a new value
+ `change`{:class="block3variables"} adds a number to a variable. If you `change by`{:class="block3variables"} a positive number, the variable value gets bigger. If you `change by`{:class="block3variables"} a negative number, then variable value gets smaller.


Another common problem is typing the name of a variable instead of dragging the variable from the `Variables`{:class="block3variables"} blocks menu. Variables should be orange:

```blocks3
say (name) for 2 seconds
```

**not**:

```blocks3
say [name] for 2 seconds
```

---
title: A change only happens once instead of forever
---

Make sure you have placed code blocks that need to keep running inside a `forever`{:class="block3control"} block. It's really common to forget to do this!

---
title: Number comparisons conditions aren't working
---

Are you sure you have used the `>`{:class="block3operators"} (greater than) and `<`{:class="block3operators"} (less than) operators the right way around?

```blocks3
<(health) > 0> // means the health variable must be bigger than 0
<(health) < 5> // means the health variable must be smaller than 5
```

**Tip:** The number that must be bigger goes on the wider (bigger) side of the operator symbol.

---
title: Nothing happens when I broadcast a message
---

Make sure you have a matching `when I receive`{:class="block3events"} block that does something when you `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} a message. Check that the message names match.

You might find a bug not listed here. Can you figure out how to fix it?

If you get stuck, try reading your code out loud or explaining the problem to a friend. You might spot the problem. 

We love hearing about your bugs and how you fixed them. Use the feedback button at the bottom of this page if you found a different bug in your project.
